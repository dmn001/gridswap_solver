I wrote an interactive gridswap solver in Python. The key features is that it solves any solveable 12x12 grid in under a second, and it has an interative user interface to click the black squares and solve it and show the path in the window as in the screenshot.

Controls:

Keys:
    Left - Solve
    Right - Solve
    Space - Solve
    R - Reset
    Esc - Exit

Use: run i_gridswap.py

Features:

click on squares on the window to select and deselect black squares

Press space, left or right arrow to solve

Press r to reset

In 99.99% of solveable grids it will solve in under 1 second. Press solve again if it doesn't find a solution.
